- began in 1987 with DOS and UNIX (U of CA Santa Cruz; SCO for DBII-FoxBase reverse-engineering)
- C, C++, VBA, Database Admin [MSoft platforms, also:
Oracle (1999 peak for DotCom scam in SF), then: (freelance 10 yrs, HP-ICBD 2 years till HP split)].
- moved to Ukraine (Kiyv), courted, married (happily ever after till she died of cancer in 2008)
- 2009 spherical trigonometry, Khan geometry course 100%, discovered "gimbal lock" in code and fixed, w/o knowing what that was. 
- Nov 8 2018 Paradise Fire in Northern California destroyed all my work and books except 1 filed with Library of Congress
- ES6 implemented Quaternion module with translation to Axis-Angle, Euler, Matrix (also burned up)
- 2018-2019   Geometric Algebra in python (for spherical rotations for EQCS-GCS and 3D Celestial mapping)
projecting into 2020:  Jupyter Geometric Algebra solution to EQCS-GCS coordinate system transformation
intensely interested in UNICODE implementation in Python, esp. for Identifiers (see PEP on this)
- Drake Sterling (eponym for s.a.m.; either nom might be used in documentation)
gitHub is awesome.
